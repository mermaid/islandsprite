      <description>About Me My name is Cameron Holiman and I love making things. I am a software developer and enjoy playing and collecting retro video games, making and drinking snobby coffee, watching Twitch, making props and hiking in my spare time.&#xA;My primary project is Plantir. An app to help manage your plants and keep track of their watering schedule (or fertilize, repotting, etc. Any type schedule really).&#xA;I also have a Coffee Snob Sticker app for iMessage if stickers are your thing.</description>
