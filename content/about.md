## About Me


{{< figure class="avatar" src="avatar.jpg" >}}

My name is Cameron Holiman and I love making things. I am a software developer and enjoy playing and collecting retro video games, making and drinking snobby coffee, watching Twitch, making props and hiking in my spare time.

My primary project is [Plantir](/apps). An app to help manage your plants and keep track of their watering schedule (or fertilize, repotting, etc. Any type schedule really).

I also have a [Coffee Snob Sticker app for iMessage](/apps) if stickers are your thing.
